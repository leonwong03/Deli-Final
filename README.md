if i have time add clientside:

-shopping cart that adds up the sum of the cost 
-want username:admin to be the only one that can see "Add new *blank" so they're the only ones that are able to add/delete products from the backend (create entry a new joint table to connect)
-users can change username and password 
-css to pretty all of it up (for now it is using css from out phase-3 project but need to make it more professional looking)
-after login goes to home or list (h ref on button)

Note: 
-a lot more seeding needs to be done but will start off with these products first( the store owner gave me a stack of papers with all their products and prices)
